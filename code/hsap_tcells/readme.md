Code for (1) trimming, aligning, and counting reads for RNA-seq data from hsap T cells, and (2) for performing edgeR differential gene expression. 

- d0: Naive T cells differentiating into Th17 cells in the presence of unconditioned decidual cell medium (0 days of decidualization). d0_1, d0_2, d0_3, d0_4 correspond to control_1, control_2, control_3, and control_4 samples in the GEO dataset. _
- d2: Naive T cells differentiating into Th17 cells in the presence of conditioned decidual cell medium (2 days of decidualization). d2_2, d2_3, d2_5, and d2_6 correspond to conditioned_1, conditioned_2, conditioned_3, and conditioned_4 samples in the GEO dataset.
